# AND Gate

## Description
The **AND** gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction - it behaves according to the truth table on the bottom.

A HIGH output results only if both the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH. If neither or only one input to the AND gate is HIGH, a LOW output results. In another sense, the function of AND effectively finds the minimum between two binary digits, just as the OR function finds the maximum.


**Therefore, the output is always 0 except when all the inputs are 1.**

## Logic table

| INPUT 1   | INPUT   |  OUTPUT    |
|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| Low       | Low     |  Low       |
| `High`    | Low     |  Low       |
| Low       | `High`  |  Low       |
| `High`    | `High`  |  `High`    |
